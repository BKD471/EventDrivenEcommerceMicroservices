/**
 * Service interface for handling payment processing operations.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for validating payment
 * requests, interacting with external or internal payment gateways, updating
 * payment status, and returning a unique identifier representing the processed
 * payment transaction. The method executes asynchronously to avoid blocking
 * caller threads.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Asynchronous Execution:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The {@link #pay(PaymentRequest)} method returns immediately with a
 *         {@link CompletableFuture}, allowing the caller to continue without waiting.</li>
 *     <li>The future completes with the generated payment ID or completes exceptionally
 *         if a processing error occurs.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * CompletableFuture<Integer> future = paymentService.pay(paymentRequest);
 *
 * future.thenAccept(paymentId -> {
 *     // handle successful payment
 * }).exceptionally(ex -> {
 *     // handle errors
 *     return null;
 * });
 * </pre>
